Great question — you're touching on an important nuance between **Static Site Generation (SSG)**, **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**, and **Dynamic Routes** in Next.js (especially in the `app/` directory).

Let’s break it down based on **your random logic + dynamic route + server component** situation:

---

### 🧠 What You’re Doing

You have a dynamic route like:

```js
/app/blog/[blogID]/page.js
```

And inside, you're doing this:

```js
const randomNumber = Math.random();
if (randomNumber < 0.5) throw new Error("Random error");
```

So you’re expecting this to run **at request time**, like SSR. But it **sometimes fails at build time** — why?

---

## 🧩 The Confusion: Dynamic Routes ≠ Always Dynamic Rendering

In Next.js (app directory):

- Just because your route is **dynamic** (like `[blogID]`) doesn’t mean it's always SSR.
- Next.js may **pre-render known dynamic routes at build time** using `getStaticPaths`-like logic under the hood.
- If you **don't explicitly tell Next.js to avoid static optimization**, it might try to **pre-render even dynamic routes** during build!

### ✅ How to Force SSR / Runtime Rendering

You should use this at the top of your `page.js`:

```js
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

This tells Next.js:

> "Hey! Do not statically pre-render this page at build time — always render it on request (SSR-style)."

✅ Now, `Math.random()` will always run **on every request**, not during `next build`.

---

### 🔁 What's the Difference?

| Type | When it Runs | `Math.random()` result |
|------|--------------|------------------------|
| Static (SSG) | At `next build` | Same number for all users |
| Server-Side (SSR / force-dynamic) | On **each request** | New number each time |
| Client-side (`useEffect`) | In browser | Runs only in client |

---

### 🚀 TL;DR for You

> **If you're using dynamic routes and want SSR-like behavior (fresh result every request), add:**

```js
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

This is **safe**, consistent, and avoids random build-time errors from `Math.random()`.

Let me know if you want a practical example with logging to confirm the difference live — I can mock that too.
