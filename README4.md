You're already off to a solid start with foundational Next.js concepts. To follow the **80/20 rule** (focusing on the 20% of concepts that bring 80% of the value), hereâ€™s what I recommend learning next in **priority order**:

---

### âœ… **1. Data Fetching Techniques (Essential for most apps)**
- `getServerSideProps` (SSR)
- `getStaticProps` (SSG)
- `getStaticPaths` (for dynamic SSG routes)
- **Client-side fetching** using `useEffect` and `fetch()` or `axios`

These are crucial to master real-world apps with performance and SEO in mind.

---

### âœ… **2. API Routes in Next.js**
- Learn how to create your own backend inside `app/api` or `pages/api`
- Understand how `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` work
- Build a small **CRUD app** using API routes + client components

---

### âœ… **3. Authentication & Authorization**
- Use **NextAuth.js** or **Auth.js**
- Learn about:
  - Session-based auth
  - Token-based (JWT) auth
  - Protecting client & server routes

---

### âœ… **4. Middleware**
- Useful for handling auth checks, redirects, or logging on every request
- Learn `middleware.ts` and when it runs

---

### âœ… **5. File-based Caching and Revalidation**
- `revalidateTag`, `revalidatePath`, ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
- Learn `cache`, `no-store`, and on-demand revalidation

---

### âœ… **6. Server Actions (New in Next.js 14+ with React 19)**
- Learn about calling server functions directly from forms or components

---

### âœ… **7. Styling Ecosystem**
- Tailwind CSS (if you haven't already)
- CSS modules
- Handling global vs scoped styles

---

### ðŸ”¥ BONUS (optional advanced topics):
- Middleware + Edge Functions
- Image Optimization (`next/image`)
- Deployment strategies (Vercel, Netlify)
